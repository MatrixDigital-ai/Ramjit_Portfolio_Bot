                    over two decades as the{" "}
                    <em>strategic force behind the scenes</em> — the person CXOs call when

                    implementation is what the moment demands.

                    When <strong>Hutch</strong> was building India&apos;s early mobile
                    telecom landscape, I was part of the team architecting both operational
                    infrastructure and market demand simultaneously. When India&apos;s
                    first free internet service launched, I was designing the on-ground
                    activations that made it a reality in multiple cities. These
                    weren&apos;t campaigns — they were{" "}
                    <em>market-creation events</em> that changed how an entire nation
