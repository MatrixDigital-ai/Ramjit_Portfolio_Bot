                        &quot;The &apos;Amader Choice&apos; campaign turned Kolkata&apos;s
                        biggest cultural moment into a city-wide brand event that millions

                        Pepsi needed to own the Durga Puja season — the world&apos;s largest
                        open-air festival. The challenge wasn&apos;t visibility; it was
                        emotional ownership. A public voting mechanism was designed inviting
                        citizens to choose the best puja pandal, making Pepsi the curator of
                        civic pride rather than just another sponsor. The result: mass
                        organic participation, earned media, and brand association that
                        outlasted the season by years.
